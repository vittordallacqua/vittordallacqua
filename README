> Computer Science undergraduate (5/8) at Universidade 
  Positivo (Curitiba-BR). Interested in data analysis 
  and full-stack development. I like metal music and
  go out with my friends. I love my wife. Here you'll
  be able to find the projects i developed during my 
  learning time. Trying to develop a project to analyse 
  data from the premier league (i love football a lot - 
  but not as much as my wife).
