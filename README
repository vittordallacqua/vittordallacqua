 > Computer Science undergraduate (5/8) at Universidade 
   Positivo (Curitiba-BR). Interested in data analysis 
   and back-end development. I like metal music and go 
   out with my friends. I love my wife. Here you'll be 
   able to find the projects i developed during my 
   learning time. Trying to develop a project to analyse 
   data from the premier league (i love football a lot - 
   but not as much as my wife).
