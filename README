Computer Science undergraduate (5/8) at Universidade 
Positivo (Curitiba-BR). Interested in data analysis 
and full-stack development. I like metal music and
go out with my friends. I love my wife. Here you'll
be able to find the projects i developed during my 
learning time. Trying to develop a project to analyse 
data from the premier league (i love football a lot - 
but not as much as my wife).

Stuff i've been learning: WSL2 + Arch, a lot of shell
script, and trying to improve my low level language
abilities, such as C and C++ (i'll never touch assembly
again). I've always thought the topic of embedded systems 
was cool and how low-level language can directly manipulate 
hardware.

This is my profile. If you're interested in what you see 
and, by any chance, you recruit passionate young developers
give me a shot! I'd be happy to chat :)
